                <h2>OVERFISHING / ILLEGAL FISHING</h2>
                <p>
                    Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is one of a range of factors that is putting fish stocks in the Coral Triangle and Pacific region at risk. Several million tonnes of fish are taken by IUU fishing each year in the Asia-Pacific, representing a significant portion of the total catch from the Pacific Ocean.

                    UNSUSTAINABLE TOURISM</h2>
                <p>

                    Unsustainable tourism, often in the form of mass tourism, can negatively impact the Coral Triangle's delicate balance in many ways: pressure on nature's carrying capacity, exploitative development of coastal areas, "leakage" of benefits away from local populations, cultural and social degradation, higher costs to service tourists, and direct environmental damage.
                </p>

                <h2>HABITAT DEGRADATION</h2>
                <p>
                    The coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds that are home to the Coral Triangle's biodiversity are considerably threatened by direct human impacts (e.g. pollution). The consequences of climate change, such as the warming and the acidification of the ocean, could make things even worse, for both wildlife and the communities that depend directly on healthy ecosystems.
                </p>

                <h2>IRRESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS</h2>
                <p>
                    Trade in the Coral Triangle hinges on the availability of funds provided by financial institutions to businesses small and large. Too often, these are provided without the appropriate screens or safeguards to ensure that businesses operate according to sound environmental and social principles.
